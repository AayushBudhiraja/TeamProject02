For this project our team started off by finding out what the main goal of this project is. We had come to the conclusion that what we needed to get done with the project was to make a program that would use ArrayList and LinkedList to create an AbstractList. I got tasked with implementing all the methods in the test method to see whether the program worked. As a team we diligently started working on the files and had a few run-ins with the code that prevented us from executing code, but we polished up the code to make it run properly. Our team was hard working throughout the project and worked/communicated properly. Throughout the project we used GitHub to work on the project together and see what changes were made to the project. We also communicated our ideas, problems, and doubts through Discord. Each member worked on their share of the project fairly and helped others when help was needed. Overall my take on this project was that we did start off slow but we managed to get done with what was required from us.
