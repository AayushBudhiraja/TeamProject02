In my perspective of the team project, I believe that I was a big part in our discussion to get things started and organized. 
Some other things I did were: I made a google doc so that everybody could get a good platform to build off of conceptually. I contributed bits and pieces of code in the AbstractList, mainly trying to get the remove and clear method to work, 
and had a small role in debugging. In the end, I remade the test client based off of the original
version of itself that Lee had made so that it would run more smoothly and output with more clarity. 
Added some comments to the code as well.
